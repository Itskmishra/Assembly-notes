In this notes we are primarily seeing Â x86 and x86-64, but that is just one family of many. To make it even more complicated, there is also competing Syntaxes. The two dominant syntaxes in the x86 world are Intel and AT&T. While the instructions are all the same, the way they are represented is completely different.

**The fundamental difference between the two is that Intel is (opcode) (destination) (source) while AT&T is (opcode) (source) (destination)**
